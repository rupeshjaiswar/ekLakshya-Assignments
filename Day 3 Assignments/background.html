            (mother) Awards Full list Website Official website Edit this at Wikidata Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio (/dɪˈkæprioʊ/, Italian: [diˈkaːprjo]; born November 11, 1974) is an American actor, producer and environmentalist.
            He has often played unconventional roles, particularly in biopics and period films. As of 2019, his films have grossed US$7.2 billion worldwide, and he has placed eight times in annual rankings of the highest-paid actors in the world. Born
            in Los Angeles, DiCaprio began his career by appearing in television commercials in the late 1980s. In the early 1990s, he played recurring roles in various television series, such as the sitcom Parenthood. He had his first major film role
            in This Boy's Life (1993) and received acclaim for his supporting role as a developmentally disabled boy in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993). He achieved international stardom in the epic romance Titanic (1997), which became the highest-grossing
            film to that point. After a few commercially unsuccessful films, DiCaprio starred in two successful features in 2002: the biographical crime drama Catch Me If You Can and the historical drama Gangs of New York, which marked his first of many
            collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. DiCaprio portrayed Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) and continued to receive acclaim for his performances in the political thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the crime drama The Departed (2006),
            and the romantic drama Revolutionary Road (2008). In the 2010s, he starred in the science fiction thriller Inception (2010), the western Django Unchained (2012), the biopic The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), the survival drama The Revenant (2015),
            and the comedy-drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), all of which were critical and commercial successes. His accolades include an Academy Award, a BAFTA, and a Golden Globe Award for The Revenant as well as two other Golden Globes for
            The Aviator and The Wolf of Wall Street. DiCaprio is the founder of Appian Way Productions—a production company that has produced some of his films and the documentary series Greensburg (2008–2010)—and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a non-profit
            organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness. He regularly supports charitable causes and has produced several documentaries on the environment. In 2005, he was named the commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his
            contributions to the arts, and in 2016, he was listed as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time. Early life and acting background Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born on November 11, 1974 in Los Angeles, California,[1] the
            only child of Irmelin (née Indenbirken), a legal secretary, and George DiCaprio, an underground comix writer, publisher, and distributor of comic books.[2] DiCaprio's father is of Italian and German descent. DiCaprio is conversant in Italian.[3][4]
            DiCaprio's maternal grandfather, Wilhelm Indenbirken, was German,[5] and his maternal grandmother, Helene Indenbirken, was a Russian-born German citizen.[6][7] In an interview in Russia, DiCaprio referred to himself as "half-Russian" and said
            that two of his late grandparents were Russian.[6] DiCaprio's parents met while attending college and moved to Los Angeles after graduating.[8] A portrait of Leonardo da Vinci DiCaprio was named after Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci[9]
            DiCaprio was named Leonardo because his pregnant mother was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in the Uffizi museum in Florence, Italy when he first kicked.[9][a] His parents separated when he was a year old; they initially agreed to
            live next door to each other so as not to deprive DiCaprio of his father's presence in his life.[11][12] However, DiCaprio and his mother later moved around to multiple Los Angeles neighborhoods, such as Echo Park and Los Feliz, while the
            latter worked several jobs.[8] He attended Seeds Elementary School and later went to John Marshall High School a few blocks away after attending the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years.[13] DiCaprio has said that he hated
            public school and often asked his mother to take him to auditions instead to improve their financial situation.[14] He dropped out of high school following his third year, eventually earning his general equivalency diploma (GED).[15] DiCaprio
            has said his career choice as a child was to become a marine biologist or an actor, but he eventually favored the latter, as he was fond of impersonating characters and imitating people.[16] When he was two, he went on stage at a performance
            festival and danced spontaneously; the cheerful response from the crowd started his interest in performing.[17] When his older stepbrother earned $50,000 for a television commercial, DiCaprio, fascinated with this, decided to become an actor.[18]
            In 1979, DiCaprio was removed, at the age of five, from the set of the children's television series Romper Room for being disruptive.[19][20] He began appearing in several commercials at age 14 for Matchbox cars by Mattel, which he considered
            his first role,[19][21] and later for Kraft Foods, Bubble Yum, and Apple Jacks.[22] In 1989, he played the role of Glen in two episodes of the television show The New Lassie.[23][24] At the beginning of his career, DiCaprio had difficulty
            finding an agent. One agent suggested he change his name to Lenny Williams to appeal to the American audience, which he declined to do.[25][26] He remained jobless for a year and a half even after 100 auditions. Disillusioned at this, he initially
            decided to quit acting, but his father encouraged him not to give up, and he needed the money to support his mother.[25] By the early 1990s, he began acting regularly on television, starting with a role in the pilot of The Outsiders (1990)
            and one episode of the soap opera Santa Barbara (1990), in which he played the young Mason Capwell.[27] DiCaprio got a break that year when he was cast in Parenthood, a series based on a successful comedy film of the same name. Before being
            cast in the role of Garry Buckman, a troubled teenager, he analyzed Joaquin Phoenix's performance in the original film.[28] His work that year earned him two nominations at the 12th Youth in Film Awards—Best Young Actor in a Daytime Series
            for Santa Barbara and Best Young Actor Starring in a New Television Series for Parenthood.[29] DiCaprio was also a celebrity contestant on the children's game show Fun House, on which he performed several stunts, including catching the fish
            inside a small pool using only his teeth.[30][31] In 1991, DiCaprio played an un-credited role in one episode of Roseanne.[32] He made his film debut later that year as the stepson of an evil landlord in the low-budget horror direct-to-video
            film Critters 3, a role he described as "your average, no-depth, standard kid with blond hair."[33] DiCaprio prefers not to remember his role in Critters 3, which he describes as "possibly one of the worst films of all time. I guess it was
            a good example to look back and make sure it doesn't happen again."[34] Later that year, he became a recurring cast member on the sitcom Growing Pains, playing Luke Brower, a homeless boy who is taken in by the Seaver family.[35] Costar Joanna
            Kerns recalls DiCaprio being "especially intelligent and disarming for his age" but also mischievous on set.[36] The teenage DiCaprio was cast by the producers to appeal to the teenage female audiences, but when the show's ratings did not
            improve, DiCaprio left it.[35] He was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor Co-starring in a Television Series.[37] Lasse Hallström holding a mic in his left hand and looking away from the camera Lasse Hallström directed
            DiCaprio in his first Academy Award-nominated role in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) In 1992, DiCaprio played a supporting role in the first installment of the Poison Ivy film series,[38] and was handpicked by Robert De Niro out of 400
            young actors to play the lead role in Michael Caton-Jones's This Boy's Life. He played opposite De Niro, who was acting as his stepfather, and Ellen Barkin as his mother.[19][39] Caton-Jones has said DiCaprio did not know how to behave on
            set; he applied a strict mentoring style that he said resulted in improvements in DiCaprio's behavior.[36] Bilge Ebiri of Rolling Stone found it "an evocative, touching little movie, defined by the powerful bond between Barkin and DiCaprio",
            praising his complex growth from "a wide-eyed son to a rebellious greaser to an independent, sensitive young man".[38] In 1993, DiCaprio co-starred as the intellectually disabled brother of Johnny Depp's character in What's Eating Gilbert
            Grape, a comic-tragic odyssey of a dysfunctional Iowa family. Director Lasse Hallström admitted he was initially looking for a less good-looking actor, but cast DiCaprio when he contacted Caton-Jones and he had emerged as "the most observant
            actor" among all who auditioned.[36][33] The film became a critical success,[40] earning DiCaprio a National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor and nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award.[41] "The film's real
            show-stopping turn comes from Mr. DiCaprio", wrote The New York Times critic Janet Maslin, "who makes Arnie's many tics so startling and vivid that at first he is difficult to watch. The performance has a sharp, desperate intensity from beginning
            to end."[42] Caryn James, also writing for The New York Times, said of his performances in This Boy's Life and What's Eating Gilbert Grape: "He made the raw, emotional neediness of those boys completely natural and powerful."[43] DiCaprio's
            first effort of 1995 was in Sam Raimi's western film The Quick and the Dead. Sony Pictures was dubious over DiCaprio's casting, and as a result, costar Sharon Stone paid his salary herself.[44] The film was released to a dismal box office
            performance, barely grossing $18.5 million in the US, and received mixed reviews from critics.[45] DiCaprio's next film in 1995 was The Basketball Diaries, a biopic, in which he played a teenage Jim Carroll as a drug-addicted high school basketball
            player and writer.[46] DiCaprio next starred alongside David Thewlis in Agnieszka Holland's erotic drama Total Eclipse, a fictionalized account of the homosexual relationship between Arthur Rimbaud (DiCaprio) and Paul Verlaine (Thewlis). He
            replaced River Phoenix, who died before filming began.[11] The film grossed only about $340,000 against its €6-million budget,[47] but has been included in the catalogue of Warner Archive Collection.[48] In 1996, DiCaprio starred opposite
            Claire Danes in Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet, an abridged modernization of William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy of the same name, which retained the original Shakespearean dialogue. The project grossed $147 million worldwide, and earned
            DiCaprio a Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 1997 Berlin International Film Festival.[49][50] Later that year, DiCaprio starred in Marvin's Room, a family drama revolving around two sisters, played by Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton, who are
            reunited through tragedy after 17 years of estrangement. DiCaprio portrayed Hank, Streep's character's troubled son, who has been committed to a mental asylum.[51] On his performance, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly commented: "The
            deeply gifted DiCaprio [...] keeps right up with these older pros [Keaton and Streep]. The three are so full-bodied and so powerfully affecting that you're carried along on the pleasure of being in the presence of their extraordinary talent."[51]
            Reviewing his works of his early career, David Thomson of The Guardian called DiCaprio "a revelation" in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, "very moving" in This Boy's Life, "suitably desperate" in The Basketball Diaries and "a vital spark" in Romeo
            + Juliet.[52]
